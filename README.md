Project Topic: World Poverty Measure

Introducton:

Poverty is not just the lack of the money but there are other apects of it such as  poor health, hunger, lack of clean water or deprivation of Electricity o rthe lack os education.

To provide a more complete picture multidimensional poverty measurements can be employed. With this we can see who is spoor and most importantly how. We can further tell the amount of poverty in different locations of the nation and between different sub groups of the people.

Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):
It is a poverty indicator that tells us about the numerous disadvantages that poor/ disadvantaged people endure in  terms of living conditions. health and education.
MPI measures 
1. Incidence of multidimenional poverty: The percentage of people in the total population who are multidimensionally poor.
2. Intensity: Th average number of disadvantages a poor person endures.

Datasets used in the project:

https://ophi.org.uk/global-mpi-report-2021/ : A global multidimensinal poverty index dataset provided by OPHI, an institution of UNDP.
and,
https://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty: Poverty index dataset provided by world bank.

Hypothesis testes in this proect:
1. The MPI urban and MPI rural are accurate indicators of the poverty levels (can verify by comparing it with the % population listed below poverty level).

2. The higher the difference between the income of the highest 10% and the bottom 10%, the higher the chances are for a country to fall under most poor countries.

3. The higher the annualized growth of the bottom 40% of people in terms of income the higher the chances are for that country to push of the poverty zone.
